This is one of my projects in Assembly x86.


TASK1:
I implemented the function struct node* sort(int n, struct node* node) that is
described in the task1/task1.asm file.

TASK2:
I computed the least common multiple for 2 numbers, a and b, using Euler's
algorithm, for part 1.
For part 2, I used if inside a string the parantheses were correct only using
stack push/pop operations.

TASK3:
I had to sort the words in a text by lenght and then if they had the same
lenght, I sorted them lexicographicly. I used strlen, strcmp and function calls.

TASK4:
CPU information program using bitwise operations.

BONUS_X64:
Merging 2 arrays.
